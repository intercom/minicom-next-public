## About

This is a stripped-down version of the repository you'll work on in your interview. It contains only the essential structure and dependencies to make sure things will work for you during the on-site. It's intended as a starting point for development.

## Getting Started
0. **Pre-requisites**:
   - A Node.js version greater than 18.17.0 and the `npm` command line interface. You can check for both with the following commands:
   ```bash
   node -v
   npm -v
   ```

   If you don't have them already installed, we suggest following [these steps](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Open in browser**:
   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the application.
